# Finnish Vocabulary

This repo contains my collection of basic Finnish vocabulary with German translations.  The entries are formatted for import in [VokabelBox](http://www.vokabelbox.com/) (for that purpose, use the excel file), but should be transparent enough for other purposes.  The syntax is simple: `|` separates alternatives, and brackets (`[]`) denote annotations:

> "bringen | wegbringen", "viedä | vien | vein | vienyt [2]"

means that _viedä_ has two possible translations, lists the four principal parts, and indicates the inflection class (as used in my textbook).

I tried to include principal parts for all verbs and nouns; they are, respectively:

- infinitve, 1S present tense, 1S past tense, past participle for verbs
- Nom.Sg, Gen.Sg, Part.Sg, Part.Pl for nouns

## Resources

A very useful resource for finding grammatical forms is [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page), which contains a lot of Finnish vokabulary as well as full inflection tables.

Another useful description of grammatical phenomena for learners is the [website of Kimberli Mäkäräinen](https://people.uta.fi/~km56049/finnish/) from the University of Tampere.
